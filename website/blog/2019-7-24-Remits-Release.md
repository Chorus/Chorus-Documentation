Last week at Microsoft Inspire 2019 we officially went live with [Remits](https://www.chorus.cloud/modules/remits/), our solution to the healthcare industry’s denial management challenges, and a game-changing addition to the Dynamics 365 Healthcare Accelerator ecosystem.

For the ceremonious pushing of the “Go Live” button, we were joined by David Pennington, Principal PM Manager, and Healthcare Accelerator Product R&D leaders Rajya Bhaiya and Smith Codio. This marked the most recent collaborative effort between the Chorus and Microsoft product teams. I’d like to commend Microsoft for delivering on its promise to serve as a partner, resource, and enabler.   

Special thanks also to Jim Prussack, Partner Technology Manager, as well as Edgar Wilson, Business Applications Architect for Healthcare. We look forward to a continued, impactful partnership between Microsoft and Chorus Healthcare Solutions. Microsoft’s investment in the architecture used by next-gen solutions such as Remits will truly be a launching pad for the transformation of the healthcare IT sector.  The integration of FHIR-based entities with the Common Data Model established by the Healthcare Accelerator is a boon to Dynamics 365 architects. 

Leveraging Microsoft’s [Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/), Remits is first in a line of [Chorus Health Cloud](http://www.chorus.cloud/) apps poised to forge a new standard for management of the revenue cycle. We are gearing up for the launch of our Claims, Eligibility, and Patient Pay apps, each of which will extend the capabilities of the Healthcare Accelerator by allowing legacy EDI-centric platforms to integrate with next-gen technology.

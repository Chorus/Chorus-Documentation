# **The Claim Lifecycle**
Claims within *Remits* begin life when remittance advices are received, with denials creating cases to queue follow-up.  Once follow-up is complete and denied claims are paid, cases are automatically closed and claims marked as "paid".

## Remittance Advice Import
Healthcare claims submitted to insurance companies are paid or denied after adjudication.  These payments and denials are returned on remittance advices, which is the claim's entry point into *Remits*.  These remits are either manaully keyed, or automaticaly imported into *Remits*.  

## Claim Generation
From the received payment data, *Remits* is able to reverse-engineer the original claims sent to insurance companies.  These claims are then stored and used as a reference point for future transactions.

# **Inputting Remits**
Remits make their into the system in one of two ways:
* Automatic Import
* Manual Entry

In most instances, a combination of both is required.  Automatic import of 835 data should be used whenever 835 files are available.  Manual entry can be used to enter paper remittance advices, or in cases where 835 files are not coming from a connected clearinghouse.

## Automatic Import
<!-- `This section will describe the automation of remit posting, as well as detail the settings and configuration options` -->

The posting of 835 files received by a connected clearinghouse is fully-automated.  The clearinghouse is checked daily for new downloads.

<!-- `Include paragraph on settings and config once that's added.` -->

## Manual Entry
`This section will describe the process and provide instructions on how to manually enter remits.`

## Significance 

Our goal was to make a meticulous, and often complicated process as simple and intuitive as possible. We created an all-in-one software that covers everything from data collection and graphing to scheduling and billing.

The sleek design, and more importantly the ease of use, creates a product that doesn’t exist in the market today.

Our hope is that through our app, providers will have a better user experience, resulting in the patients receiving better therapy.

The Eligibility App comes with two pre-defined Security Roles:
1. **Intake Manager** - users with this role can create eligibility requests and view the response information.
2. **Billing Manager** - users with this role can update subscription and billing information.

For further information regarding setting up and assigning role see [Security roles and privileges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges).

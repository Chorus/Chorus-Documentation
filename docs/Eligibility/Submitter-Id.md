During the subscription trial period, your eligibility requests are submitted with Chorus's submitter Id. 
As your trial end date approaches a Submitter account is set up with Change Healthcare clearing house.
Once the account is approved, the submitter Id of the customer is updated on the customer record. The customer's records are then submitted with their Submitter Id.

# Overview

To utilize all our functionality, every system should have Practitioners & Patients setup.

Examples of helpful functionality: 
1. If a Practitioner is entered into the system properly, we can ensure you will be aware when a Practitioner is missing the required credentials to help garuntee timely payment. 
2. If the Practitioner's Working-hours are properly entered, the Scheduler can have an easy time scheduling a Session between a Patient and Practitioner.
3. If the Patient's 'Preferred Languages' is populated, the Scheduler can schedule a Session between the Patient a Practitioner who speaks the desired language.
